As hinted at in the comment about these streams being "even lazier", it turns
out that whereas seeking to the *n*th position in the original implementation
forced the evaluation of all of the preceding elements, no such thing occurs
with our lazy stream implementation: even the value you seek to will not be
evaluated until it is forced to! This is really convenient when you have some
really expensive function that must be evaluated to retrieve a value. E.g., if
you wanted to get the 100th value in a stream but each item required a 1000ms
database lookup, you'd be waiting for quite a while without laziness, but would
get your result immediately with lazy streams.
