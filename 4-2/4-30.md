# 1
In a `begin` sequence, every item has `eval` called on it. Function applications
are evaluated, of course. Because `display` is a primitive function, it has
strict evaluation order, and it forces x, resulting in the side effect.

# 2
With the original, the results are (1 . 2) and 1 respectively. In p2, the thunk
is never forced. With Cy's changes, they both would result in (1 . 2).

# 3

Why would it? The set of possible expressions that will be evaluated earlier
has strictly increased in size.

# 4

The answer to this question hinges on whether this claim is true:

    All items in a sequence except for the last one are only there for the side
    effects they produce.

This seems like it should be true, because it's easy to see that the value of an
expression in non-final position in a sequence is discarded. If this is true,
then clearly we must prefer Cy's method, as the only possible reason for
inclusion of a non-final sequence item would be for its side-effects.
