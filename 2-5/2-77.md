Oops I wrote this file then deleted it. The gist of it is that there are two
calls to apply-generic. Of course the lower-level one is necessary to redirect
to the correct complex implementation, but the higher-level one is necessary
because we never filled the hole in the table for performing these operations on
items of type 'complex.
