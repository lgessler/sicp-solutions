Recall that `queue` contains not the queue itself but a pair of the front
pointer and the rear pointer. To obtain the queue itself, just call `car` on the
queue representation. 

As for why the last item remains in the rear pointer even after the last
deletion, cf. footnote 22, which explains that since `empty-queue?` only looks
at the front pointer, we need not modify the rear pointer in this case.
