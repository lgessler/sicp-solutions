Side note: are the authors trolling us by naming one of the params `things`?
That's one way to get people to pay better attention to their variable names, I
guess.

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items '()))
```

The problem here is that the first result is `cons`ed onto the empty
list. Uh oh.

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items '()))
```

This is even worse--`answer` is a list, so we're left with a left-heavy binary
tree. Not great.
