;; Ben's version:
(define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
  (let ((i (an-integer-between low high))
        (hsq (* high high)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
      (let ((ksq (+ (* i i) (* j j))))
        (require (>= hsq ksq))
        (let ((k (sqrt ksq)))
          (require (integer? k))
          (list i j k))))))

;; Some of the operations that Ben is using are pretty expensive (like
;; `integer?` and `sqrt`, but these contribute scalar quantities only. 
;; Let n = high - low. Ben's version is then O(n^2), whereas the original
;; solution is O(n^3). Ben's is faster.
