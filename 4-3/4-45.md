I'm so happy you asked! I'll use parens to vaguely show constituent structure:

    (The professor) (lectures (to (the student (in the class) (with the cat))))
    (The professor) (lectures (to (the student (in the class (with the cat)))))
    (The professor) (lectures (to (the student (in the class))) (with the cat))
    (The professor) (lectures (to (the student)) (in the class) (with the cat))
    (The professor) (lectures (to (the student)) (in the class (with the cat)))

In the first, the student is in the class and has a cat.

In the second, the student is in the class which is known for having a cat.

In the third, the student is in the class and the professor is using the cat to
lecture.

In the fourth, the professor is lecturing in the class and is using a cat.

In the fifth, the professor is lecturing in the class which is known for having
a cat.
