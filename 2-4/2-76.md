Explicit dispatch is, of course, not suitable in either of these situations. 

I don't really see the difference here between the two styles. Whenever a type
is added, in both cases the other types' code don't have to be modified: in
message-passing style you just create a new constructor, and in data-directed
style you just create a new installation method.

But the community answers mention that this is an instance of the [expression
problem](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExpressionProblem). I don't get it.
