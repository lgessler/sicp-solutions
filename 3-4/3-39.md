Let's label the chunks of code with a caret and a number:

```
(lambda () (set!^2 x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))^1))
(s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))^3)
```

Note that 2 may not occur before 1. This gives us three orderings:

```
1 2 3 -> 101
1 3 2 -> 100
3 1 2 -> 121
```

There is also a fourth case that I missed because 3 and 2 can be interleaved!
Before the last step of 3--setting x to x + 1--it is possible for 2 to execute,
setting x to 100, but only to have execution return to 3 and set x to 11.
Tricky!
