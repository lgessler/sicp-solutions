Suppose that for some reason the users of this system must spread their money
out thinly across very many accounts. To withdraw some amount of money, then, it
is common to empty out $n$ accounts until the amount is reached, and it is also
common to deposit small amounts of money across $n$ accounts. Suppose also that
the order of accounts in which money should be deposited or from which money
should be withdrawn can be specified at the time of withdrawal or deposit.

It's easy to see how this could result in a deadlock: suppose that P1 wants to
withdraw from accounts A, B, C, and D and P2 wants to deposit to accounts C, D,
E, and F. It's likely that P1 and P2 will be caught in deadlock at some point.
