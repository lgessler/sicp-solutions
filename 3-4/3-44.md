Actually, it's different. We don't need to acquire both mutexes to ensure
correct behavior here. For the swap we needed both because there was an
intervening time between the time the balance was observed and the time the
withdrawal and deposit was made wherein the balances' states could have changed.
But here there is only a withdrawal and a deposit, so it's fine.
