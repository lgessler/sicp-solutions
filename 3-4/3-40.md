P1 consists of these steps (in pseudo-assembly):

1. load x %r1
2. load x %r2
3. mul %r1 %r2
4. store %r1 x

P2 consists of these steps:

a. load x %r3
b. load x %r4
c. load x %r5
d. mul %r3 %r4 %r5
e. store %r3 x

Thus any of execution order where 2 follows 1 etc., and b follows a etc., is
possible. Instead of enumerating all the possible combinations, just think about
what matters: the other process completing (and storing a new value of x) while
the other process is still in the process of laoding x.

4 before a -> 100 * 100 * 100 = 1000000
4 before b -> 10 * 100 * 100  = 100000
4 before c -> 10 * 10 * 100   = 10000
4 after c  -> 10 * 10 * 10    = 1000
e before 1 -> 1000 * 1000     = 1000000
e before 2 -> 10 * 1000       = 10000
e after 2  -> 10 * 10         = 100

After we apply the serializer (which people usually call a mutex...), we only
get the "intended" result, 1M.
