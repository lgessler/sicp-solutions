# Recursive

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

The solution is recursive, as the reference to the function `inc` is not
invoked until the stack as "bottomed out". We can visualize the stack like so
for the invocation `(+ 4 5)`:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

# Iterative

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

This solution is iterative as none of its state is stored on the stack. Again,
for `(+ 4 5)`: 

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```
