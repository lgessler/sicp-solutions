Again, the code: 

```scheme
(define (count-change amount) (cc amount 5))
(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
        (else (+ (cc amount
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                 (cc (- amount
                        (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
                     kinds-of-coins)))))
(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
 (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
  ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
  ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
  ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
  ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
```

`(count-change 11)` amounts to this. (This is an abridged trace of the
execution--dead ends are left out.) Note that in this tree the left child uses
the current denomination, and the right child will use the next denomination.

                                         (11 4)         
                                         (11 3)
                                  (11 2)        (11 3)
                             (6 2)     (11 1)  (1 3)
                         (1 2)   (6 1) (10 1)    (1 2)     
                          (1 1)  (5 1)  (9 1)      (1 1)       
                          (0 1)  (4 1)  (...)    (0 1)
                                 (3 1)  (0 1)         
                                 (2 1)           
                                 (1 1)
                                 (0 1)
```
