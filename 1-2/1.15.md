a. For every recursive application of `angle`, an application of `p` is made.
   12.15 can be divided by 3.0 five times before it is below 0.1, so 5
   applications of `p` are made.
b. Space grows logarithmically as the number of applications of `p` needs
   to be implicitly tracked in the stack. When we triple a, we only add an
   additional application. The same for the number of steps.
